DISCO:
* JavaScript emphasis and necessary for styline
* Alignment is not done by float attribute in classes but simply in the class tag
* Foundation uses libraries to control javascript functions such as MotionUI and Style Sherpa
* Foundation and Bootstrap have plugins, which control data manipulation and viewing

Questions/Comments/Concerns:
* Why does the button in line 111 specify a type while the button in line 110 does not
* When JavaScript is removed, website still loads.
  * Dropdown menus, slider, closables do not function as they were meant
  * Navbar looks extremely similar to Bootstrap when JavaScript is removed
* Pagination and "show kittens" button not functioning
* Both have a 12 column structure for gridtables

Q0:
* Looked through foundation docs to understand previously defined attributes and
  emphasis on script
* Was not necessary to look through docs for understanding, but wanted to see other
  aspects of Foundation that may not have been included.
