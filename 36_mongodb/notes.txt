K36 -- Another DB Perspective
2022-05-03

- Follows JSON format. What came first?
- Keys must be in qhotes
- How popular is BSON?
- There are different ways to export (BSON vs JSON)
- import puts data in instance/cluster, export does opposite
- Many documents and collections built in
- There is an admin database, kind of like how shells have a sudo user
- commands build on specficity of location they are being used at
- Are the "any 20 documents" random or determined by order they are in the document
