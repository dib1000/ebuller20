2022-04-28

- How apps use data is everchanging and can cause for dramatic restrcturing of RDBMS databases
- MongoDB lets you easy change your application by having the appication and datamodel build on each other
- Need to determine applicaton workload to help determine data size, operations to manipulate data, and how to structure database
- link data has refernces/roles connected to the thing. Embed data has the data within the information ofthe object
- Have to get the details about how large the data and its uses are
- The document approach seems to be efficient
