K39 -- Another DB Perspective
2022-05-12

- Aggregation is for finding things in a certain order in an array
- Filters = words with dollar signs at beginning
- Group filters and puts data into different parts of the answer array
- 67 zipcodes with 0 people?
- cursor method applies to results that are found
- SORT FIRST
- indexes make things faster (less sort time)
- indexes can compound each other
- Data is stored the way that it is used
- Main considerations of needed data + how will it be queried
- Data that is used together should be stored together
- Upsert = Update + Insert (will either update or insert doc depending on if document exists)
- Only use upsert for conditional updates
