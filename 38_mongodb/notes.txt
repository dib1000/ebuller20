- Query operators help you locate and compare data
- { <field>" {"Operator": <value>}}
- can use multiple query operators 
- may not be useful if there are only two values for a field
- This chapter makes you do more of the exercises
- Logic operators are the usual (and, or, not)
- square brackets denote array of statements
- nor is kind of the opposite of and
- $and is seen implicitly in querys in general
- Use and when you need to include same operator more than once in a query
- If we need a numerical value, do we need to do find().count(), or can we just use count()
- expr lets you compare values within document (with a dollar sign in the front)
- aggregation has operator field first
- can only use $fields in $expr?
- only mix 1s and 0s if you get rid of _id value
- only use 1s and 0s. Using both will show error
-elemMatch is used in array values
- projection is the second value of the find/count functions
-elemMatch can be used in the nonprojection field
- go more in depth with .
