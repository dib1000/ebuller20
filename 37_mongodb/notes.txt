K37 -- Another DB Perspective (MONGO)
2022-05-09

- _id forces documents to have unique values
- ObjectId or just inserting various strings lets you insert values for _id
- findOne() without inputs finds a random document
- insert returns a WriteResult
- You can insert document with id value but no _id value (_id is randomly generated using ObjectId)
- Collections can have various types of documents with different values
- Insert crashes after one error
- can toggle off adding multiple docs from left to right
- Can create collections when doing db.<new_collection_name>.insert
- Store objects within objects
- MQL has various operators with $ at the beginning
- inc adds, set changes value
- new values to dictionary get added through $set update
- you should only use deleteOne when querying based on _id, runs risk to deleting many docs
- different from dropping collection
